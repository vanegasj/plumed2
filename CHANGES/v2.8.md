## Version 2.8 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.8

- Changes leading to differences with previous versions
  - in \ref METAD if possible the root walker in WALKERS_MPI will set the folder from which reading the GRID/HILLS file upon restart
  - in \ref METAD work is not calculated by default anymore, if needed it can be obtained using CALC_WORK
  - in \ref METAD an error will be thrown if when restarting from FILE the file is not found

- Other improvements
  - in \ref METAD a new keyword NLIST has been added to use a neighbor list for bias evaluation, this should be faster than grids with many CVs
  - in \ref METAD there are more checks that a restart of WALKERS_MPI is working consistently among walkers
  - in \ref driver there is a flag `--restart` that can be used to enforce restart (similar to using \ref RESTART in the PLUMED input file).

- Changes in the OPES module
  - new action \ref OPES_EXPANDED
  - various new actions of type \ref EXPANSION_CV to be used with \ref OPES_EXPANDED
  - new action \ref OPES_METAD_EXPLORE
